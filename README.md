# Random Stock Generator In Python!

🎨 Background

This Random stock generator works by generating one initial number between 1-100. Then after the initial number is generated it can either go up or down. This is decided by a random number between 0 and 1. Then to decide how much for the value to go up or down we have another random number between 1-20.

Just note the buy and sell buttons don't work which I will fix in the coming updates, so stay tuned.

⚒️ Requirements

For This project, you will need the latest version of Python. You will need the Pygame library which after you have Python you can install by running the command ```pip install python```.

👋 Now you should have your very own user interface with a random stock generator. Sorry I haven't made a project for so long, but here is what I have been working on! 👋
